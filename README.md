# Custom Queue Backgrounds

This mod allows you to customize the background of the queue.

Instead of being limited to 21 overridable background images, this mod introduces folder-based support ‚Äî you can add any number of images to the designated folders.

> Comes with over 80 images, including the game's default backgrounds and other Wargaming imagery.
## üîß How to Change Images
Navigate to: 

`gui\flash\imagePrebattleLoading`

You'll find two folders:
- `standard` ‚Äì for normal queue backgrounds
- `holiday_maneuvers` ‚Äì for Holiday Maneuvers event backgrounds

To customize:
1. Add or remove images in either folder.
2. Supported formats: `.dds`, `.png`, `.jpg`
3. Images will be selected at random when loading.

> If the images don‚Äôt match your screen resolution, they may appear cropped or with black bars.
